This repository contains the code for cleaning, transforming and visualizing data from Environmental Services, whose researchers were monitoring COVID-19 prevalence in the metro area by analyzing SARS CoV-2 viral RNA load in Metro Plant wastewater.

## Data update schedule  

The Council generated daily wastewater data for the period of November 1, 2020 to September 27, 2023. It has transitioned to having all wastewater monitoring accomplished through the National Wastewater Surveillance System and the University of Minnesota Medical School Wastewater Project. 

[University of Minnesota Medical School Wastewater Project](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/a8d269bd670a421e9fd45f967f23f13c?data_id=dataSource_1-regions_wwtp_view_6302%3A2l)

[National Wastewater Surveillance System](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#wastewater-surveillance)

## Structure  

All processing scripts for data and figures are in ./R. The prefix "d" indicates data processing, while the prefix "fig" indicates figure processing. `0_run_all.R` runs all scripts and saves final data. 

```{r}
fs::dir_tree("R", recurse = 1)
```

The Shiny app is located in ./metc-wastewater-covid-monitor. /data contains relevant CSV data and /www contains CSS, HTML, and relevant font files the app needs upon running. 

```{r}
fs::dir_tree("metc-wastewater-covid-monitor/", 0)
```

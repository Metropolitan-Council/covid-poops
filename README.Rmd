This repository contains the code for cleaning, transforming and visualizing data from Environmental Services, whose researchers are monitoring COVID-19 prevalence in the metro area by analyzing SARS CoV-2 viral RNA load in Metro Plant wastewater.

## Data update schedule  

All data used in the interactive Shiny app lives in `/metc-wastewater-covid-monitor/data`. Though samples are taken daily, samples are processed and analyzed in the University of Minnesota Genomics Center lab once a week. We aim to release the weekly data update every Friday before noon.  

## Structure  

All processing scripts for data and figures are in ./R. The prefix "d" indicates data processing, while the prefix "fig" indicates figure processing. `0_run_all.R` runs all scripts and saves final data. 

```{r}
fs::dir_tree("R", recurse = 1)
```

The Shiny app is located in ./metc-wastewater-covid-monitor. /data contains relevant CSV data and /www contains CSS, HTML, and relevant font files the app needs upon running. 

```{r}
fs::dir_tree("metc-wastewater-covid-monitor/", 0)
```
